# Phenomenalism in SC

I keep coming back to the topic of phenomenalism in Star Citizen. A part of what is making this particular video difficult, has to do, I think, with the paper I am basing it on, namely John Cogburn and Mark Silcox's "The Game Inside the Mind, the Mind Inside the Game" from their book *Philosophy Through Video Games*. I believe that my approach has been too broad. I have been attempting to systematically focus on each important point they make. But a part of the problem, with the paper, for me is that there are many many important points. It is unjust, I think to give them all the equal weight that they are, I think, owed. As such, after at least giving a very broad overview of the main conclusion, and what I think are the most significant points in defense of that conclusion, I will then focus on what point in particular. This point has to do with their conclusion that enactivism is a better explanation of a successful game.

> Reflection upon the strengths and weaknesses of some of these theories can help us understand why nearly everyone mistakenly expected that demand for competitorsâ€™ consoles would be so much higher than for the Wii, and also why Wii play does seem more realistic to many gamers.

According to @cogb09, the XBox 360 was predicted to outperform the Nintendo Wii because the prevailing view of realism was phenomenalism. It was thought that what made a desirable gaming system was it's representation of reality. But according to Cogburn *et al*, the measure was only one dimensional, focusing on photorealism only. They will go on to argue that the more accurate measure is the degree to which the representation can be manipulated by the user.
