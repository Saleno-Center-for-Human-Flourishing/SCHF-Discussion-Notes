# Phenomenalism in SC

Assuming that what makes a video game enterprise, like Star Citizen, successful, is its representation of what is reality, an important question in this context, game development, is what counts as real. For this, we need a theory of realism. Why this is important, is because one prevailing view about what makes a successful game enterprise, is the way that that game accurately represents the way things are. That what the consumers of video games want above all else, are games that accurately reflect reality.

Philosophically speaking, this question is known as realism and anti-realism. There are different treatments of this question which span across various philosophical subdisciplines, including but not limited to, the philosophy of science, metaphysics / epistemology, and value theory. There are of course many different versions the question, depending on the relevant philosophical sub-discipline. For instance, in value theory, ergo, ethics, we might ask whether moral judgments accurately reflect the way things are. When stating moral value judgments, do we say something true about the real world? Do these judgments track truth of the real world?

But we are not here to talk about the existence of moral truths that our judgments may or may not track, but rather we are here to talk about what it means to represent reality. The right answer here ought to tell us what will make a given video game successful. At least according to @cogb09, it should.

First, one particular question that the realism and anti-realism debate tracks, is what is known as "the question of the external world". Those who are somewhat familiar with philosophical debates, might think that this is a metaphysical question. However, the way I will approach it here, the way I believe @cogb09 to approach it, is epistemically. Therefore, the question that we are asking, is how do we experience our environment? The correct theory about how we experience our environment, will tell game developers how they should represent our environment.

For our purposes here, we will only look at two views. These are enactivism and phenomenalism.

According to phenomenalist theories, we do not directly perceive our environments. Rather, we have various sensory experiences and from these, we infer various facts about our environment.

For instance, @russ12 in his book *Problems with Philosophy* gives an example of this view.

> To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. Anyone else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem that no difficulty would arise.

Accordingly, we only perceive sense data, things that are immediately known to the senses:

* colours
* sounds
* smells
* hardness
* roughness

But not objects.

I keep coming back to the topic of phenomenalism in Star Citizen. Star Citizen is a mass multiplayer online universe. It has also been called a sand box. It is still in development so for me, it is not clear what its end state is going to be. Personally, my hope has always been, and will always be, that it ends up becoming more like a simulator than anything else. It is perhaps one of the most immersive game environments available. Upon clicking "launch" on the RSI launcher, I wait a couple of dozen seconds where I am met with a menu screen. I have the option of selecting "Persistent Universe" or "Squadron 51". These are both games in the process of development by the company Cloud Imperium Games or CIG for short. Squadron 42 is similar to Call of Duty or other first person shooters. There are various possibilities however beyond what you might expect to find in a first person shooter, including squadron battles where you can participate with up to 12 other people in a 12 on 12 battle. These battles can be won in fighter craft, and other vehicles or on foot. They are fun, but the really interesting aspect of loading into Star Citizen is the persistent universe itself. One's understanding of Squadron 51 changes when viewing it in contrast to the PU.

The PU is a massive time sync. Not only does it take time loading the game, but everything takes time doing. On logging into the PU, I find myself lying down and looking at the area in front of my face which I understand to be above my head. Scrolling out, I see that I am in something like a "rack" one might find on a Navy or Coast Guard ship. Looking around, I am in a small room, there is a small shower / commode, a couple of counters, some closet space etc. The area I find myself in is a habitation unit, or hab for short. It's where I reside, although this mechanic is one of the more unfinished aspects of the game. As soon as I leave this area, there is no way to re-enter it except by logging out and back in. Thanks to persistent streaming, sometimes, items I leave here, empty bottles and cans, guns, articles of clothing etc, may be there when I return, although this is hit and miss.

There are many activities a player can do in the 'verse. These include mining, looting, transporting cargo, piracy, dogfighting, pvp battles on foot or in vehicle. Unlike Squadron 51 however, doing these activities is more than just a matter of select and spawn. This is one of the time syncs.

Imagine if you will, waking up in your bunk inside your hab. You stand up and quickly open your mobi-glass. A mobi-glass is something like a cellphone and it can become as addicting as one. Here you can look though your notifications, check your health and nutrition status, view your assets. What you are likely to do however is look for completable missions, assuming that you are playing solely and not a part of a party with pre-established plans.

You look for some missions that will earn you in-game credits that you can trade for other in-game items like ships, clothing, armor, ground vehicles, etc. Assuming that you are laser focused and not easily distracted by all the interesting graphics, random items in your closet, the fact that you can open all the drawers in your hab where some have additional manipulatable items and some do not, 5 minutes might have gone by. If you are easily distracted, then you can easily spend an hour admiring your new virtual world.

However, you still need to walk (everyone runs in SC) to the transportation platform. It can be far, and if you are new and do not have a guide, it is easy to get lost. If you know your way around pretty well, then it can be easy to get distracted. Each area has its own distractions. There is Soviet-esque art in the subways of Lorreville, neon, glamour, fanciful clubs in New Babbage, manufacture advertisements in Area 18. You can take a tram, or maglift, etc., from the transportation platform to the space port. Riker Memorial on ArcCorp, Interstellar on New Babbage, etc. More time has elapsed. Of course, with time, experience, advice from other players etc., you begin to learn shortcuts. You minimize the distractions. You also begin to better understand the physics of the game. For instance, you learn that you cannot sell that cargo that you have in your hanger because you forgot to deliver it when you tried to complete that cargo mission last week. No use in wasting 10 precious minutes fudging with the terminal inside the TDD (Trade Development Division).

So yes, Star Citizen is a time sync. But the time that you spend here helps you to create a stronger bond with this world. If one is looking for realism in a video game, than the greatest factor, or dimension, is the amount of time that they spend with the game, and the relationships that they forge in and around it. So a theory of realism in video game development, should include the passage of time.

I've tried to do this video on realism and Star Citizen before. It is a difficult subject. A part of what is making this particular video difficult, has to do, I think, with the paper I am basing it on, namely John Cogburn and Mark Silcox's "The Game Inside the Mind, the Mind Inside the Game" from their book *Philosophy Through Video Games*. But it is more than that. Firstly, I believe that my approach has been too broad. I have been attempting to systematically focus on each important point they make. But a part of the problem, with the paper, for me is that there are many many important points. It is unjust, I think to give them all the equal weight that they are, I think, owed. As such, after at least giving a very broad overview of the main conclusion, and what I think are the most significant points in defense of that conclusion, I will then focus on one point in particular. This point has to do with their conclusion that enactivism is a better explanation of a successful game.

> Reflection upon the strengths and weaknesses of some of these theories can help us understand why nearly everyone mistakenly expected that demand for competitorsâ€™ consoles would be so much higher than for the Wii, and also why Wii play does seem more realistic to many gamers.

According to @cogb09, the XBox 360 was predicted to outperform the Nintendo Wii because the prevailing view of realism was phenomenalism. It was thought that what made a desirable gaming system was it's representation of reality. But according to Cogburn *et al*, the measure was only one dimensional, focusing on photorealism only. They will go on to argue that the more accurate measure is the degree to which the representation can be manipulated by the user. What this means is that our own determination of realism is a measure of the degree to which we can manipulate ourselves and our environment.

What is enactivism? Enactivism is a theory of realism, namely, it concerns a question about what it means for something to be real. If you were going to try to recreate reality, either through movie production, authoring a book, or creating a video game, what would you focus on? Which aspects of reality would you focus on? Would a focus solely on the graphical representation of the object that you are trying to render be adequate to accomplish your goals?

More importantly however, than how the environment is rendered and manipulated, is the question about why we should think that phenomenalist theories of realism play second fiddle to enactivist theories.

At the base of the argument is a question about how we perceive the world around us. Of course for this any knowledge about how our faculties are a part of the process that gives us the ability to respond and adapt to our environments.

For instance, the philosopher Bertrand Russell in his book *Problems with Philosophy*, argued that because there is no faculty that perceives the world directly through its different aspects, then the world that we perceive is something like an illusion. We can only perceive those things that are "immediately known in sensation" [@russ12, 12].

According to Russell, we only perceive sense data, not objects directly.
